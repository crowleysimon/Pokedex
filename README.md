# Pokedex [actual name TBD]

This pokedex app is currently a üößÔ∏è **work-in-progress** üößÔ∏è that I'm using to learn some android development practices/libraries that I don't have much experience with:

* Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (I've been writing mostly in kotlin since 2018)
* Uses [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) for asynchronous work (I have experience with RxJava but not coroutines)
* Uses [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) for dependency injection (Previously only ever used Dagger2 for DI)
* [Store](https://github.com/dropbox/Store) for implementing repository concept (never used store before)
* [MvRx](https://github.com/airbnb/MvRx) (used to MVP and MVVM)
* [Epoxy](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy) for recyclerviews and since it supposedly integrates with MvRx (usually use something standard or lately groupie)
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) for caching (I don't have much experience with Room)
* [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) for image loading (used to use picasso, then glide, now coil!)
* Uses the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) as the source of pokemon data
